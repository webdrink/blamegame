# React Party Game Framework

> **A modern, extensible framework for building interactive party games with React, TypeScript, and comprehensive internationalization support.**

## 🎯 What is this Framework?

After months of fighting with React state management, wrestling with TypeScript generics, and discovering that "it works on my machine" is not a deployment strategy, we've somehow managed to create a framework that actually works. 

This battle-tested foundation provides everything you need for building party games like BlameGame, complete with all the features we wish we had when we started this journey:

- **🎮 Multiple Game Types**: Modular architecture that actually makes sense (unlike our first 3 attempts)
- **🌍 Internationalization**: Full i18n support with automatic translation tools *(because manually translating 500+ questions in 4 languages is not fun)*
- **📱 Progressive Web App**: Offline support and app-like experience *(because sometimes the internet is as reliable as our initial estimates)*
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Framer Motion animations and Tailwind CSS styling *(after we gave up on making CSS Grid work like we wanted)*
- **🧪 Testing Ready**: Comprehensive Playwright test infrastructure *(learned the hard way that "it works" ≠ "it works reliably")*
- **⚡ Fast Development**: Vite build system with hot module replacement *(because life's too short to wait for webpack)*

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript

### Create Your First Game

```bash
# Clone the framework (this part usually works)
git clone <repository-url>
cd <framework-directory>

# Install dependencies (pray to the npm gods)
pnpm install

# Start development server (fingers crossed)
pnpm dev
```

Your game will be available at `http://localhost:5173` *(assuming you don't have anything else running on that port)*

**✨ In 5 minutes, you'll have a working party game!**  
*(\*Results may vary. "Working" is subjective. Your definition of 5 minutes may differ from ours.)*

## 🏗️ Framework Architecture

### Core Concepts

```
🎮 Game Module System
├── Phase Controllers    # Game state management
├── Screen Components    # UI screens for each phase
├── Data Providers      # Question/content management
└── Framework Components # Reusable game UI

🔧 Supporting Systems
├── Internationalization # Multi-language support
├── State Management    # Zustand stores
├── Animation System    # Framer Motion integration
└── Testing Framework   # Playwright E2E tests
```

### Game Flow Example

```typescript
// Define your game phases
const gamePhases = [
  { id: 'intro', screen: 'intro' },
  { id: 'setup', screen: 'setup' },
  { id: 'play', screen: 'play' },
  { id: 'summary', screen: 'summary' }
];

// Create a game module
const MyGameModule: GameModule = {
  id: 'mygame',
  async init(ctx) {
    // Initialize game data
  },
  registerScreens() {
    return {
      intro: MyIntroScreen,
      setup: MySetupScreen,
      play: MyGameScreen,
      summary: MySummaryScreen
    };
  }
};
```

## 🎮 Built-in Game: NameBlame

The framework includes a complete party game implementation that demonstrates all framework capabilities:

### Game Features
- **👥 3+ Player Support**: Dynamic player management
- **❓ Question Categories**: Humorous blame scenarios
- **🌍 4+ Languages**: English, German, Spanish, French
- **📱 Mobile Optimized**: Touch-friendly interface
- **🎨 Smooth Animations**: Engaging visual feedback

### NameBlame Flow
```
Intro → Player Setup → Question Play → Blame Selection → Summary
```

Each phase demonstrates different framework capabilities:
- **Intro**: Settings and configuration
- **Setup**: Dynamic UI based on game mode
- **Play**: Content loading and user interaction
- **Summary**: Data aggregation and presentation

## 🎯 Framework Benefits

### For Game Developers
- **⚡ Rapid Development**: Pre-built components and patterns *(no more reinventing the wheel for the 47th time)*
- **🔧 Flexible Architecture**: Easy to customize and extend *(because we learned from our rigid, unmaintainable first attempt)*
- **🌍 Global Ready**: Built-in internationalization *(so you don't have to hardcode strings and regret it later)*
- **📱 Modern UX**: Animations and responsive design *(that actually work across different screen sizes)*
- **🧪 Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing tools *(because "QA will catch it" is not a strategy)*

### For Teams
- **📚 Great Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples *(that we actually keep updated, unlike our first version)*
- **🔄 Consistent Patterns**: Standardized development approaches *(learned after creating 5 different button components)*
- **🛠️ Developer Tools**: Debug panels and development aids *(because `console.log` debugging gets old fast)*
- **📊 Performance**: Optimized build and runtime performance *(after we fixed all the memory leaks)*

pnpm test:nameblame
pnpm test:framework

# Build for production (cross your fingers)
pnpm build

# Preview production build (because prod is always different)
pnpm preview
