## üß© Project Architecture (Completed Framework)

BlameGame now uses a modern modular framework architecture:

1. **Framework Core** - EventBus, modules, routing, and phase controllers
2. **Stable UI System** - Persistent GameShell with header/footer that never reload
3. **Game Modules** - Pluggable games (NameBlame fully implemented)
4. **Content Providers** - Abstracted content delivery with StaticListProvider
5. **Config-Driven UI** - All features controlled by game.json configuration
6. **Complete Translation** - German localization with proper category names
7. **Enhanced Game Flows** - Classic and NameBlame modes with manual category selection

## üåê Multilingual Support (Complete Implementation)

The application has complete multilingual support with:
- **German (de)** - Full implementation with category translations
- **English (en)** - Complete UI translation
- **Spanish (es)** - UI translation support
- **French (fr)** - UI translation support

**‚úÖ Translation Features:**
- Category names properly translated and displayed
- All UI elements localized
- Settings and preferences persist language choice
- Framework supports easy addition of new languages

## üß™ Testing (Framework Complete)

**‚úÖ All Testing Complete:**
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Production build success
- Framework component tests created
- Runtime testing verified
- Cross-browser compatibility confirmed

Framework-specific tests cover EventBus, modules, providers, storage, and phase controllers.

## üéØ **Project Complete**

**Status**: All major objectives achieved with enhanced features delivered beyond original scope. The BlameGame framework migration is **100% complete** and ready for production.
