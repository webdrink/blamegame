# Documentation Index

Complete index of all React Party Game Framework documentation, organized by audience and use case.

*"We have so much documentation that we needed documentation for our documentation."* - The Meta-Documentation Team

## 📖 Documentation Overview

The React Party Game Framework documentation is organized into four main sections *(because three seemed too simple and five seemed excessive)*:

1. **[Getting Started](#-getting-started)** - Setup, installation, and first game
2. **[Architecture](#-architecture)** - Framework design and core concepts  
3. **[Developer Guides](#-developer-guides)** - Step-by-step implementation guides
4. **[API Reference](#-api-reference)** - Complete API documentation

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Start here if you're new to the framework**

### Essential First Steps
- **[README](README.md)** - Framework overview and quick start
- **[Installation](getting-started/README.md)** - Setup your development environment
- **[First Game Tutorial](getting-started/first-game.md)** - Build a complete "Truth or Dare" game
- **[Code Examples](getting-started/examples/)** - Working code snippets and templates

### Quick Navigation
```
New Developer Path (The "Please Work On My Machine" Journey):
README → Installation → First Game Tutorial → Architecture Overview
            ↓
    "Wait, why isn't this working?"
            ↓
    Debugging → Stack Overflow/ChatGPTing → Energy Drink → Success
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Understand how the framework works internally**

### Core Concepts
- **[Architecture Overview](architecture/README.md)** - High-level framework design
- **[Framework Core](architecture/framework-core.md)** - Event bus, modules, phases, actions
- **[Game Modules](architecture/game-modules.md)** - Creating and organizing game logic
- **[Component System](architecture/component-system.md)** - UI component architecture
- **[State Management](architecture/state-management.md)** - Data flow and state patterns
- **[Phase System](architecture/phase-system.md)** - Game progression and routing
- **[Data Providers](architecture/data-providers.md)** - Content and data management

### Architecture Learning Path
```
Architecture Overview → Framework Core → Game Modules → Component System
                                ↓
                    "Oh, that's why it works that way!"
                                ↓
                    Regret about previous implementation choices
```

## 📖 Developer Guides

**Step-by-step guides for common development tasks**

### Essential Guides
- **[Creating Components](guides/creating-components.md)** - Component development patterns
- **[Config-Driven Settings](guides/config-driven-settings.md)** - Build Settings UI from game.json
- **[Internationalization](guides/internationalization.md)** - Multi-language support ✨
- **[Testing](guides/testing.md)** - Testing strategies and tools ✨
- **[Animations](guides/animations.md)** - Using Framer Motion effectively
- **[Theming](guides/theming.md)** - Customizing appearance and styling
- **[PWA Setup](guides/pwa-setup.md)** - Progressive Web App features
- **[Deployment](guides/deployment.md)** - Building and deploying games

### Recommended Learning Sequence
```
For UI Development (The "Make It Pretty" Path):
Creating Components → Animations → Theming
                        ↓
            "Why does it look different in Safari?"

For Complete Games (The "Ship It" Path):  
Creating Components → Internationalization → Testing → Deployment
                                                ↓
                            "It works on my machine..."

For Production (The "Now We're Serious" Path):
All Guides + PWA Setup + Deployment + Prayer + Sacrifice to Demo Gods
```
