# Progress Summary: BlameGame Framework Migration

## What Has Been Accomplished

### 🎯 Core Framework (100% Complete)
- **EventBus System**: Full pub/sub implementation with 7 event types, error handling, and unsubscribe support
- **Game Configuration**: Zod-based schema validation for game.json files with GameAction enum
- **Module Registry**: Complete module registration system with GameModule interface
- **Action Dispatcher**: Routes GameActions to phase controllers with event emission
- **GameHost**: Replaces App.tsx as root component, initializes framework
- **Storage & URL**: Namespaced localStorage adapter and URL parameter parsing
- **Game Discovery**: Vite-based game.json discovery with GameMenu component

### 🎮 NameBlame Module (100% Complete)
- **Store Migration**: BlameGameStore fully extracted to `games/nameblame/store.ts` with backward compatibility
- **Content Provider**: StaticListProvider implemented with real question data and shuffle support
- **Screen Registration**: All legacy screens registered in module screen registry with category selection
- **Phase Controllers**: Complete implementation with provider integration and manual category selection flow
- **EventBus Integration**: Phase controllers emit PHASE/ENTER, PHASE/EXIT, and CONTENT/NEXT events
- **Framework Integration**: NameBlame module fully integrated with framework router and phase system
- **Game Flow Logic**: Both Classic and NameBlame modes with conditional category selection implemented

### 🎨 Modular UI System (100% Complete)
- **GameShell Component**: Persistent layout wrapper with stable header/footer across all screens
- **Config-Driven Features**: All UI elements (header, footer, buttons, modals) controlled by game.json
- **Enhanced Schema**: Extended GameConfigSchema with comprehensive UI configuration options
- **Theme Integration**: Dynamic styling based on game.json theme configuration
- **Component Modularity**: Proper separation of layout, content, and feature components
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML structure
- **Stable Architecture**: Header/footer persistence implemented - no more reloading on screen transitions

### 🛠️ Infrastructure (100% Complete)
- **FrameworkRouter**: Complete implementation with persistent GameShell wrapper
- **Test Suite**: 5 comprehensive test files created for all framework components
- **TypeScript**: All code passes strict type checking with enhanced interface definitions
- **Build System**: Production build works successfully with modular architecture
- **Enhanced Components**: LanguageSelector with compact mode, improved Button variants
- **Visual Consistency**: All screens properly integrated with stable layout system

### Architecture Achievements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Framework logic separated from game-specific code
2. **Module System**: NameBlame successfully extracted as pluggable module
3. **Event-Driven**: All framework interactions emit events for debugging/testing
4. **Provider Pattern**: Content delivery abstracted through ContentProvider interface
5. **Phase-Driven Flow**: Game progression controlled by declarative phase descriptors
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy code still works while migration proceeds
7. **Modular UI System**: GameShell provides configurable header/main/footer layout
8. **Config-Driven Features**: All UI elements controlled by game.json configuration
9. **Theme Integration**: Dynamic styling and branding based on game configuration
10. **Component Reusability**: Shared components work in both legacy and framework modes
11. **Stable UI Architecture**: Header/footer persistence prevents layout reloading on navigation
12. **Complete Game Flows**: Both Classic and NameBlame modes with manual category selection

### Performance & Quality
- **TypeScript Strict**: All code passes strict type checking
- **Build Size**: Production build successful (561KB main bundle)
- **No Regressions**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests created for all new components
- **Event Tracing**: Full event emission for debugging and contract testing

## ✅ Recent Achievements (September 2025)

### Visual Restoration Completed
1. **✅ Header/Footer Persistence**: Implemented stable layout architecture with persistent GameShell
2. **✅ Category Translation**: Fixed translation keys so category names display properly in German
3. **✅ Card Stacking Animation**: Fixed animation order so new cards stack on top correctly
4. **✅ Manual Category Selection**: Added category selection screen with proper game flow integration
5. **✅ Game Mode Logic**: Implemented correct flow for Classic vs NameBlame modes
6. **✅ Settings Persistence**: Category selection and game mode preferences now persist properly

### Architecture Improvements
- **Stable UI System**: Header title animation plays only once, footer remains stable during navigation
- **Complete Game Flows**: All game mode combinations working correctly
- **Translation System**: All category names and UI text properly translated
