# BlameGame Testing Strategy

This document provides a comprehensive testing strategy for BlameGame, covering all aspects from feature testing to multilingual support verification.

## 1. Feature Testing

### Core Game Flow

1. **Game Start & Navigation**
   - Start a new game in Classic Mode
   - Start a new game in NameBlame Mode with player setup
   - Navigate through question screens
   - Complete a full game and view summary screen
   - Return to intro screen from summary

2. **Question & Category Functionality**

   - Ensure questions load properly for each selected category
   - Test progress bar and question counting

3. **NameBlame Mode**
   - Test player name input and validation
   - Verify player selection during blame assignments
   - Confirm proper blame summary statistics

### User Interface & Interaction

1. **Visual Elements**
   - Verify animations are smooth and appropriate
   - Check all layouts at different screen sizes
   - Ensure text is never truncated or overflowing
   - Test color schemes and visual feedback

2. **Interactive Components**
   - Test all buttons and interactive elements
   - Verify modals open and close correctly
   - Check hover and active states for all clickable elements
   - Ensure settings toggles work correctly

### Audio Components

1. **Sound System**

     - New question sound
     - Round start sound
     - Summary screen sound
   - Test volume control slider

## 2. PWA & Offline Functionality Testing

### PWA Installation

1. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

2. **Installation Test**
   - Open in Chrome/Edge/Safari
   - Look for install icon in browser UI
   - Complete installation process
   - Verify app opens in standalone window
   - Check app icon on desktop/home screen

### Offline Capabilities

1. **Offline Game Testing**
   - Open app while online to cache assets
   - Disconnect from internet (toggle Wi-Fi/airplane mode)
   - Refresh or restart the app
   - Verify game loads and functions properly offline
   - Test complete game flow in offline mode

2. **Cache Verification**
   - Check if questions and assets are properly cached
   - Ensure new content is updated when back online

## 3. Data Persistence Testing

1. **Settings Persistence**
   - Change language preference
   - Toggle sound on/off
   - Adjust volume level
   - Close and reopen application
   - Verify all settings are preserved

2. **Game State Persistence**
   - Add player names in NameBlame mode
   - Play through some questions
   - Close app completely
   - Reopen app and verify:
     - Player names are remembered
     - Previously played questions are not repeated

3. **Reset Functionality**
   - Test the reset function
   - Verify it properly clears localStorage
   - Confirm game returns to initial state

## 4. Multilingual Support Testing

### Language Selection and Detection

1. **Browser Language Detection**
   - Test: Open app in browser with different language preferences
   - Expected: App detects and applies closest supported language
   - Fallback: If no match, app defaults to German (DE)

2. **Language Selector UI**
   - Test: Navigate to settings and change language
   - Verify: All available languages are displayed
   - Verify: Current language is visually indicated as selected

3. **Language Persistence**
   - Test: Change language, close and reopen app
   - Verify: Selected language is remembered between sessions

### UI Translation

1. **Component Text Translation**
   - Test: Switch between languages and check all UI components
   - Verify: All text is translated to selected language
   - Verify: No hardcoded text appears in any component

2. **Variable Interpolation**
   - Test: Check components with dynamic content
   - Verify: Variables are properly interpolated in all languages
   - Verify: Sentence structure remains grammatically correct

3. **Translation Completeness**
   - Test: Navigate through all screens in each language
   - Verify: No missing translation keys or placeholders
   - Verify: No default language text appearing when different language selected

### Content Translation

1. **Category Translation**
   - Test: Change language and verify category names
   - Verify: Categories display in selected language
   - Verify: Category emojis remain consistent across languages

2. **Question Translation**
   - Test: Start game in different languages
   - Verify: Questions load in selected language
   - Verify: Fallback works if question missing in current language

3. **Language Switching During Game**
   - Test: Change language during active gameplay
   - Verify: Current game continues seamlessly
   - Verify: UI updates immediately, game state preserved

## 5. Edge Case Testing

1. **Error Handling**
   - Test: Incorrect or missing question files
   - Test: Missing sound files
   - Test: localStorage unavailable
   - Verify: Appropriate error messages appear
   - Verify: Application doesn't crash

2. **Missing Translation Handling**
   - Test: Remove or corrupt a translation key
   - Verify: App shows key name or falls back to default language
   - Verify: No crashes occur with missing translations

3. **Unsupported Language Fallback**
   - Test: Attempt to use unsupported language code
   - Verify: App falls back to default language
   - Verify: No crashing or blank screens

## 6. Performance Testing

1. **Loading Times**
   - Test: Measure initial app load time
   - Test: Measure time to load questions
   - Verify: No noticeable loading times (>300ms)

2. **Animation Performance**
   - Test: Verify smooth transitions between screens
   - Test: Check confetti animation performance
   - Test: Assess card flip animations

3. **Language Switch Performance**
   - Test: Measure time to switch languages
   - Verify: Language switching is nearly instantaneous
   - Verify: No UI lag during language transition

## 7. Cross-Device Testing

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Test on:
     - Desktop (various window sizes)
     - Tablet (or emulated tablet in DevTools)
     - Mobile phones (or emulated in DevTools)
   - Verify layout adapts correctly to all screen sizes

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test in:
     - Chrome
     - Firefox
     - Safari
     - Edge
   - Verify consistent behavior across browsers

3. **Device-Specific Features**
   - Test touch interactions on touchscreens
   - Verify media queries work as expected
   - Check orientation changes on mobile devices

## Test Reporting

For each test case, document:
1. Test date and tester name
2. Test environment (browser, device)
3. Steps taken
4. Expected vs. actual result
5. Screenshots if applicable
6. Pass/Fail status

## Regression Testing

After significant updates:
1. Retest primary game flows
2. Verify all UI components in multiple languages
3. Check for any new hardcoded text
4. Verify PWA functionality still works

This comprehensive testing approach ensures BlameGame delivers a high-quality, stable experience for all users across devices and languages.
