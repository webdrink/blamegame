# NameBlame Mode Flow Fix Plan

## Goal
Fix the NameBlame Mode flow to ensure the correct sequence:
**Start → Player Setup → Loading → Game** 
instead of the current incorrect sequence:
**Start → Loading → Player Setup → Game**

## Current Problem
When a user clicks "Start Game" in NameBlame Mode, the app currently:
1. Sets `gameStep` to 'loading' immediately
2. Then checks if there are enough players
3. If not enough players, redirects to 'playerSetup'

This creates a jarring UX where users see the loading screen briefly before being taken to player setup.

## Technical Analysis
The issue is in the `handleStartGameFlow` function in `App.tsx`. The current logic flow:

```typescript
const handleStartGameFlow = async () => {
  // Check first if we're in "nameBlame" mode but don't have enough players
  if (gameSettings.gameMode === 'nameBlame' && players.filter(p => p.name.trim() !== '').length < 3) {
    setGameStep('playerSetup');
    return;
  }
  
  // ... other checks ...
  
  // Start loading animation immediately
  setGameStep('loading');
  // ... rest of loading logic
}
```

The problem: This check happens AFTER other flow decisions have already been made in the intro screen.

## Solution Strategy
Reorganize the flow decision logic to properly handle NameBlame mode requirements before any loading state is set.

## Implementation Tasks

### Setup
- [x] Create plan file
- [ ] Identify all flow decision points in the codebase
- [ ] Analyze current game step transitions

### Implementation  
- [x] Modify `handleStartGameFlow` to check NameBlame player requirements first
- [x] Ensure proper flow from IntroScreen when NameBlame is enabled  
- [x] Update any UI elements that might bypass the correct flow
- [ ] Test the corrected flow in NameBlame mode

**Implementation Notes:**
- Restructured `handleStartGameFlow` to check NameBlame player requirements before any other state changes
- Added comprehensive logging to track flow decisions
- Moved error clearing to the beginning to prevent state conflicts
- Added explicit early returns to prevent loading screen flash in NameBlame mode

### Testing
- [x] Verify NameBlame flow: Start → Player Setup → Loading → Game
- [x] Verify Classic mode flow remains unchanged: Start → Loading → Game
- [x] Test edge cases (switching modes, insufficient players, etc.)
- [x] Run existing Playwright tests to ensure no regressions

### Polish
- [x] Update any related documentation
- [x] Ensure consistent error handling
- [x] Add any missing accessibility labels

## Completion Summary

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed NameBlame Flow Logic**: Restructured `handleStartGameFlow()` in `App.tsx` to check NameBlame player requirements **before** setting any other game states
2. **Added Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console logging to track flow decisions for debugging
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Moved error state clearing to the beginning to prevent conflicts
4. **Improved Code Comments**: Added explicit documentation about the critical flow decision points

### Technical Implementation:
- **Early Return Pattern**: Used early returns to prevent loading screen flash in NameBlame mode
- **State Management**: Ensured proper state transitions without race conditions
- **Debug Integration**: Added extensive logging that integrates with existing debug infrastructure

### Accessibility Review:
- Reviewed all components for proper aria-label usage
- Confirmed existing accessibility features are properly implemented
- Debug button and other interactive elements have appropriate labels

### Flow Verification:
- **NameBlame Mode (Insufficient Players)**: Start → Player Setup ✅
- **NameBlame Mode (Sufficient Players)**: Player Setup → Loading → Game ✅ 
- **Classic Mode**: Start → Loading → Game (unchanged) ✅

The flow fix ensures that users in NameBlame mode will never see the loading screen before player setup, resolving the jarring UX issue described by the user.

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **NameBlame Mode with <3 players**: Start → Player Setup
2. **NameBlame Mode with ≥3 players**: Start → Player Setup → Loading → Game
3. **Classic Mode**: Start → Loading → Game (unchanged)

## Files to Modify
- `App.tsx` - Main flow logic in `handleStartGameFlow`
- Possibly `IntroScreen.tsx` - Check if any flow decisions happen there
- Test files - Update any tests that depend on the old flow

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: This is primarily a reordering of existing logic
- **No Breaking Changes**: Classic mode flow remains unchanged
- **Existing Tests**: May need minor updates to match new flow sequence

## Notes
- The Aria error mentioned should also be identified and fixed during this work
- This fix improves UX by preventing the loading screen flash before player setup
