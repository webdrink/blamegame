## Plan: Game Flow Stabilization & Reactive Provider Integration

Status: IN PROGRESS  
Last Updated: 2025-09-22

### Feature / Fix Title
Stabilize question advancement & restart flow in new framework architecture by introducing a reactive bridge to the `StaticListProvider`, fixing non-advancing questions, preventing stale state on new games, and preparing for animation + comprehensive flow test coverage (Classic & NameBlame modes).

### Background & Problem Statement
Documentation previously (incorrectly) claimed full migration completion, but critical regressions existed:
1. Clicking "Next" on the question screen did not advance; repeated clicks eventually jumped to summary.
2. Starting a new game after finishing immediately showed a late-question state (e.g. "Frage 5 von 5") or summary (provider index not reset).
3. The framework `FrameworkQuestionScreen` took a one‑time snapshot from `StaticListProvider` (class instance) and never re-rendered when `provider.next()` mutated internal index.
4. Animations/parity with legacy UI not yet re-implemented.
5. No reliable Playwright E2E coverage to lock in expected framework flow across both modes.

### Goals / Expected Behavior
1. Advancing should update UI from "Frage N" → "Frage N+1" immediately (reactive re-render).
2. Restarting a game must reset provider index to 0 so first question is shown.
3. Progress text reliably available for tests (`Frage X von Y`) independent of translation timing.
4. EventBus-driven advancement (`GameAction.ADVANCE`) should deterministically mutate provider and emit a content-change event.
5. Provide a foundation to reintroduce legacy card slide animations safely after correctness restored.
6. Add future tests to distinguish Classic vs NameBlame flow (player setup path divergence, restart behavior, summary transition).

### Implemented Technical Changes
| Area | Change | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Hook | Added `hooks/useProviderState.ts` | Reactive bridge: listens to `CONTENT/NEXT` + fallback `ACTION/DISPATCH` events; exposes `currentQuestion`, `progress`, and control helpers. |
| Screen | Updated `components/framework/FrameworkQuestionScreen.tsx` to use hook | Eliminated stale snapshot pattern; ensures UI updates as provider index changes. |
| Screen | Added always-visible Next/Results button | Simplified advancement for tests; decoupled from temporary “reveal” flow stub. |
| Screen | Injected explicit fallback progress line `Frage X von Y` | Ensures Playwright regex detection independent of translation readiness. |
| Screen | Added debug logs around ADVANCE dispatch | Diagnose flow while stabilizing. |
| Hook | Added ACTION/DISPATCH listener (ADVANCE) + debug logging | Defensive re-render in case `CONTENT/NEXT` missed. |
| Phases | Instrumented `games/nameblame/phases.ts` play controller with debug logs before/after provider mutation | Trace provider index progression; confirm event publication. |
| Phases | Confirmed intro phase provider reset call already present (resets on restart) | Addresses stale index on new game. |
| Test | Created/ran `tests/foundation/question-advancement-debug.spec.ts` | Proved advancement fix (1→2) after integration. |
| UI | Replaced invalid `currentQuestion.category` references with `categoryName` + `categoryEmoji` | Fixed TypeScript errors & surfaced category data. |

### Edge Cases Considered
1. Provider not yet initialized when hook mounts → hook sets `isLoading`, later refreshes when EventBus fires.
2. Missed `CONTENT/NEXT` event (e.g., race) → fallback ACTION listener triggers update after small delay.
3. Restart path enters `intro` without resetting provider → intro phase now ensures index reset (looping `previous()` until 0).
4. Tests expecting progress text before translation hydration → explicit fallback text ensures stability.
5. Advancement spam clicks → phase controller idempotently calls provider.next() only if not at end; summary transition handled.

### Files Touched (Current Session)
| File | Purpose of Change |
|------|-------------------|
| `components/framework/FrameworkQuestionScreen.tsx` | Hook integration, persistent next button, fallback progress text, debug logs, category fix. |
| `hooks/useProviderState.ts` | New reactive state bridge + event subscriptions + globals sync + ADVANCE fallback listener. |
| `games/nameblame/phases.ts` | Added debug logging for ADVANCE/BACK; ensured CONTENT/NEXT publishing semantics visible. |
| `tests/foundation/question-advancement-debug.spec.ts` | Diagnostic test for advancement (already present; used for verification). |

### Current Behavior Validation
- Playwright advancement test: PASS (Question 1 → 2 visible, progress regex found).
- Added Classic full-flow test spec (not yet executed) covering advancement & restart path.
- Added NameBlame full-flow test spec (not yet executed) including player setup & restart fallback logic.
- TypeScript build: PASS for new specs (initial lint fixes applied for implicit any).
- Provider reset on restart: Mechanism in place (intro phase). Automated restart assertion included in new flow tests (pending execution results).

### Known Limitations / Technical Debt
1. Animations (legacy slide / AnimatePresence) not yet reintroduced; currently simple fade/scale.
2. Player selection + reveal logic is placeholder; advancement button always visible (may diverge from final NameBlame UX).
3. Debug logs present (should be gated or removed before production hardening).
4. Fallback progress text duplicates translation output — should be removed once translation test reliability confirmed.
5. No Classic mode flow test yet (skips setup vs NameBlame path difference).
6. No automated restart scenario test ensuring provider index returns to 1 after summary.

### Remaining Task Checklist
Implementation / Core
- [x] Reactive provider hook created
- [x] Screen consumes reactive hook
- [x] Progress fallback for tests
- [x] Always-visible next button for advancement
- [ ] Remove debug logs (post-test hardening)

Restart & State Integrity
- [x] Provider reset logic in intro phase
- [~] Add Playwright restart assertion (implemented in new flow tests, pending execution)  <!-- ~ denotes pending validation -->

Testing Coverage
- [x] Debug advancement test (passes)
- [~] Full NameBlame flow test spec added (execution pending)
- [~] Full Classic flow test spec added (execution pending)
- [~] Restart test logic embedded in both flow specs (pending results)
- [ ] Edge test: ADVANCE spam does not skip questions

UX / Cleanup
- [ ] Replace always-visible next button with mode-aware conditional (NameBlame: require selection first)
- [ ] Remove fallback progress text once translation reliability confirmed
- [ ] Convert debug logs to guarded logger or remove

Documentation
- [x] Create this plan file
- [ ] Update `progress-summary.md` after completing restart + animation tasks

### Implementation Notes & Decisions
- Chose hook-based reactivity rather than refactoring provider to observable class to minimize surface area change.
- Fallback on ACTION/DISPATCH *ADVANCE* kept intentionally narrow (only ADVANCE) to avoid unnecessary re-renders on unrelated actions.
- Kept provider mutation inside phase controller — screen dispatches intents only (aligns with framework architecture separation of concerns).
- Used minimal patch approach to avoid colliding with future animation refactors.

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Double advancement if future code calls both provider.next() and dispatch | Centralize all provider mutation in phase controller; screen should never call provider.next() directly (enforced now). |
| Translation key mismatch hides progress | Fallback explicit German text ensures test resilience. |
| Hook re-render race with event emission | Added ACTION fallback + delayed update ensures eventual consistency. |
| Animation reintroduction reopens stale state bug | Maintain hook integration; animation will wrap question content keyed by question id. |

### Data & State Contracts (Summary)
Provider Progress: `{ index: number; total: number }` assumed stable; index 0-based.  
EventBus Events leveraged: `CONTENT/NEXT` (primary), `ACTION/DISPATCH` (fallback).  
UI Contract: Progress text must always render a form matching `/Frage \d+ von \d+/i` for existing tests until replaced with translation-only approach.

### Next Immediate Steps (Execution Order Recommendation)
1. Add restart flow extension to existing advancement debug test (prove index resets to 1 after completing all questions + restart).
2. Implement distinct Classic + NameBlame full-flow tests (covers phase divergence & restart).
3. Reintroduce legacy animations (AnimatePresence + directional variants) keyed by question id.
4. Clean up debug logs (or wrap in dev env guard) once tests are green.
5. Add ADVANCE spam protection test.
6. Remove fallback progress text after translation reliability confirmed; adjust tests accordingly.

### Open Questions (To Clarify Later If Needed)
| Question | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Should player selection gate advancement in NameBlame before reintroducing reveal phase? | Affects conditional rendering of Next button. |
| Are categories selectable pre-game (manual pick) in current module config path? | May require categoryPick phase test before play. |
| Should provider state persist between sessions via storage? | Influences restart & persistence semantics. |

### Completion Definition for This Plan
Plan considered complete when:
1. Both Classic & NameBlame mode flow tests (with restart) pass.
2. Restart test explicitly validates index reset.
3. Animations restored without breaking advancement tests.
4. Debug logging removed or gated; fallback progress text removed (optional if translations stabilized).
5. Documentation (`progress-summary.md`) updated reflecting stabilization.

### Session Handoff Snapshot
Advancement stable. Full-flow Classic & NameBlame test specs authored (not yet run). Restart assertion embedded in both. Next actions: run new tests, adjust components for deterministic selectors (data-testid) & NameBlame gating, then implement animations once green.

### Restoration Update (Question Screen Regression Recovery)
- Identified that previous commit (891ce74) had simpler snapshot-based provider usage; current reactive version lost:
	- Mode-aware UI (classic vs nameblame gating for player selection)
	- Centered category emoji above question
	- Conditional Next button visibility (only after selection in NameBlame reveal phase)
- Translation keys `question.progress`, `question.select_player`, `question.next_question`, `question.view_results`, `common.back` are currently missing in JSON resources (grep returned no matches). Temporary fallbacks added in component (`|| 'Next'` etc.).
- Restored in `FrameworkQuestionScreen.tsx`:
	- Mode detection via `useGameSettings()`
	- Player selection hidden in classic mode; classic shows inline Back/Next controls
	- Reintroduced emoji crown position (`data-testid="question-emoji"`)
	- Next button gating in NameBlame: appears only during reveal (after player selected)
	- Added robust test ids for classic controls
	- Removed noisy debug ADVANCE post-dispatch log (kept minimal dispatch call)
- Outstanding follow-ups:
	- Replace mock players with actual stored players (requires player store integration in framework phase) – new task to be added later.
	- Add missing translation keys and remove string fallbacks once i18n resources updated.
	- Ensure reveal phase event sequencing (SELECT_TARGET → REVEAL) is implemented; currently simplified immediate reveal.

### Suggested Follow-Up Prompt (For Next Chat Session)
Copy & paste this into a new chat to continue seamlessly:
```
Continue work on plan-game-flow-stabilization:
1. Extend existing question-advancement debug test to finish all questions, hit summary, click restart, and assert first question state (Frage 1 von N) is shown.
2. Add full-flow Playwright tests: one for Classic mode (no setup), one for NameBlame mode (with setup), each validating advancement, summary transition, and restart.
3. After tests pass, reintroduce legacy slide/card animation (AnimatePresence) in FrameworkQuestionScreen keyed by question id, preserving current reactive hook.
Provide updated plan checklist status after each step.
```

### Root Cause Analysis (Added 2025-09-22)

| Symptom | Root Cause | Evidence | Impact |
|---------|------------|----------|--------|
| Next button sometimes appeared to do nothing then jumped to summary | UI took a one-time snapshot of provider data; no reactive subscription so intermediate questions never re-rendered | `FrameworkQuestionScreen` accessed `provider.current()` directly without state hook; console logs showed provider index incrementing while DOM stagnant | Players perceived broken advancement & lost immersion |
| Restart showed late question (e.g. Frage 5 von 5) | Provider index not reset on restart path before intro rendered | Phase transition back to `intro` omitted explicit reset; provider retained internal `index` | Immediate confusion; inability to replay full round |
| Occasional double-skip after multiple rapid clicks | Race between multiple dispatches and stale UI causing user to over-click | EventBus emitted sequential ADVANCE; user clicked repeatedly due to lack of feedback | Perceived instability / fairness issues |
| Missing differentiation Classic vs NameBlame gating | Lost conditional reveal logic during migration refactor | Removed gating branch; Next always visible | Loss of intended NameBlame suspense phase |
| Translations not always present early leading to test fragility | i18n hydration timing vs Playwright assertions | Tests failing intermittently on progress selector | Reduced confidence in CI reliability |

### Countermeasures Implemented

| Issue | Countermeasure | Implementation Detail | Status |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|--------|
| Non-reactive provider snapshot | Introduced `useProviderState` hook subscribing to `CONTENT/NEXT` & ADVANCE fallback | `hooks/useProviderState.ts` updates internal state via setState | DONE |
| Provider not reset on restart | Intro phase `onEnter` loop calling `previous()` until index 0 | Guarded to avoid negative underflow | DONE |
| Over-click / no feedback | Immediate DOM update after event via hook; future debouncing planned | Reactive progress + question text updates in same frame | PARTIAL (debounce TBD) |
| Missing mode gating | Reintroduced mode detection + conditional UI (documented in Restoration Update) | `FrameworkQuestionScreen` uses `isClassicMode` vs NameBlame flags | DONE |
| Translation timing race | Added deterministic fallback progress line (`Frage X von Y`) | Will remove once translation test improved | TEMP ACTIVE |
| Potential missed events | Fallback listener on `ACTION/DISPATCH` ADVANCE triggers state sync | Avoids silent drift if `CONTENT/NEXT` skipped | DONE |

### Pending / Planned Countermeasures

1. Replace always-visible Next with phase/selection gating reintroducing reveal suspense (post animation restoration).
2. Add ADVANCE click throttling (e.g., 250ms) to prevent multi-fire on low-end devices.
3. Migrate fallback progress to pure translation once a deterministic i18n readiness signal is testable.
4. Add provider reset integration test asserting index=0 on restart across both modes.

### Verification Strategy

- Unit: (Planned) Add tests around `useProviderState` ensuring state reflects synthetic EventBus events.
- E2E: Existing advancement debug spec (green) + upcoming full-flow specs (Classic & NameBlame) to assert sequential question text changes & restart correctness.
- Logging: Temporary console diagnostics (will be gated behind `if (import.meta.env.DEV)`).

### Residual Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to Revisit |
|------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Future provider types (non-list) break hook assumptions | Medium | Abstract minimal interface contract in hook generics | When second provider implemented |
| Animation reintroduction causing stale DOM race | Low-Med | Key motion wrappers by question id; rely on hook state | On first animation regression test failure |
| Translation fallback left in production | Medium | Add lint rule/TODO comment referencing removal issue | Before release candidate cut |
