### Plans
The `plans/` subdirectory contains planning documents for features that have already been implemented. These are kept for historical record of the development process.

## Why We Archive

Instead of deleting old documentation, we archive it to:
1. Preserve the project history
2. Maintain references that might be linked from comments or commit messages
3. Keep design rationales accessible
4. Provide context for implementation decisions

## Using Archived Documentation

These documents should be treated as historical artifacts and not as current guidance. If you need information about current implementation, please refer to the main documentation files in the `/docs/` directory.
