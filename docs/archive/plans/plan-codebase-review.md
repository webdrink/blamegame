# Plan: Codebase Review Documentation

## Goal
Create documentation files summarizing the repository structure, components, and dependencies. Generate lists for Markdown files and components. Provide a project overview.

## Steps
1. Search the repository for all Markdown and text files and save as `docs_index.md`.
2. From existing documentation files, extract information about project goals, main components, and dependencies. Compile summary in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.
3. Inspect components under `components/`, `context/`, `lib/`, and create an inventory JSON listing purpose, props, and dependencies.
4. Update `components_dependency_map.md` with an ASCII representation of component dependencies.
5. No changes to application logic.

## Edge Cases
- Some components may be empty; they will be noted with minimal information.

## Impact
- Adds documentation files only; no code changes.

## Checklist
- [x] docs_index.md created
- [x] PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md created
- [x] components_inventory.json created
- [x] components_dependency_map.md created
