# Component Cleanup Plan

## Purpose
This plan outlines the approach to clean up duplicate and redundant components in the BlameGame project, focusing specifically on the QuestionScreenNew component that has been merged into the original QuestionScreen component.

## Background
During the bugfix process, a new component called `QuestionScreenNew.tsx` was created to solve issues with game UI not appearing after the intro screen. The component implemented several fixes and improvements, but created a parallel implementation that diverged from the original component structure.

After successful testing and confirmation that the merged solution works, the duplicate component should be removed to maintain a cleaner codebase.

## Actions Taken
1. **Merged Important Features**: The important features from QuestionScreenNew were merged into the original QuestionScreen component:
   - Added proper header with the BlameGame title
   - Fixed issues with category emoji display
   - Ensured proper navigation between questions
   - Added improved documentation

2. **Updated App.tsx**: Changed the import statement to point back to the original QuestionScreen component.

3. **Updated Documentation**: The FIXES_SUMMARY.md file has been updated to reflect these changes.

## Next Steps
1. **Remove QuestionScreenNew.tsx**: Since all necessary functionality is now in the original component, the temporary component can be deleted.

2. **Testing**: Test the application thoroughly to ensure all functionality works correctly after the removal:
   - Confirm the game UI appears correctly after the intro screen
   - Verify that category emojis display properly
   - Test navigation between questions

3. **Code Cleanup**: Check for any other references to QuestionScreenNew in the codebase that might need to be updated.

## Implementation Notes
This cleanup improves the maintainability of the codebase by:
- Reducing duplication
- Maintaining a single source of truth for the question screen component
- Simplifying future updates by having only one component to modify
- Following the project's component organization principles

## Conclusion
By consolidating the functionality back into the original component and removing the temporary solution, we maintain a cleaner, more maintainable codebase while preserving all the fixes and improvements made during the bugfix process.
