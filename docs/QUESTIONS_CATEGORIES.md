# Question and Category Data Structure

This document provides a comprehensive overview of how question and category data is organized in BlameGame.

## 1. Overview

BlameGame's content is organized into a flexible, maintainable structure designed to:

1. Support multiple languages
2. Allow easy addition of new categories and questions
3. Provide fallback mechanisms for missing translations
4. Enable category-based question organization

## 2. Directory Structure

The primary data resides in the `public/questions/` directory:

```
public/
â””â”€â”€ questions/
    â”œâ”€â”€ categories.json         # Central file with all category definitions and translations
    â””â”€â”€ {lang}/                 # Language-specific directories (e.g., 'en', 'de')
        â””â”€â”€ {category_id}.json  # Question files named by category ID
```

## 3. File Formats

### 3.1. Categories (categories.json)

This file contains an array of category objects, each with an `id`, `emoji`, and translations for all supported languages:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "party",
    "emoji": "ðŸŽ‰",
    "en": "Party",
    "de": "Party",
    "es": "Fiesta",
    "fr": "FÃªte"
  },
  {
    "id": "work",
    "emoji": "ðŸ’¼",
    "en": "Work",
    "de": "Arbeit",
    "es": "Trabajo",
    "fr": "Travail"
  }
  // ... more categories
]
```
The `id` field is crucial as it's used to name the corresponding question JSON file (e.g., `party.json`).

### 3.2. Questions (e.g., en/party.json)

Each language directory contains category-specific question files. For example, `public/questions/en/party.json` would contain an array of question objects for the "party" category in English:

```json
[
  {
    "questionId": "party_q1_en",
    "text": "Who is most likely to dance on the table?",
    "category": "party"
  },
  {
    "questionId": "party_q2_en",
    "text": "Who would be the DJ at a party?",
    "category": "party"
  }
  // ... more questions
]
```
- `questionId`: A unique identifier for the question.
- `text`: The question text.
- `category`: The `id` of the category this question belongs to. This should match an `id` in `categories.json`.

## 4. Data Loading Flow

The application loads question and category data using the `useQuestions` hook, which utilizes consolidated loading logic in `lib/utils/questionLoaders.ts`:

1.  **Load Categories**:
    *   Fetches `public/questions/categories.json`.
    *   The `loadQuestionsFromJson` function in `lib/utils/questionLoaders.ts` handles this.
2.  **Select Categories (New Logic)**:
    *   The `useQuestions` hook will randomly select a configured number of categories (e.g., 10) from the loaded `categories.json`.
3.  **Load Questions for Selected Categories**:
    *   For each selected category `id` and the current `gameSettings.language`:
        *   It attempts to load the corresponding question file: `public/questions/{lang}/{category_id}.json`.
        *   This is handled by `loadQuestionsFromJson` in `lib/utils/questionLoaders.ts`.
        *   The `getAssetsPath` utility is used to ensure correct URL construction, especially for GitHub Pages deployment.
    *   Fallback logic is implemented: if a question file for the specific language is not found, it may attempt to load from a default language (e.g., English).
4.  **Process and Combine Questions**:
    *   Questions from all successfully loaded files are combined.
    *   Each question object is enhanced with `categoryId`, `categoryName` (translated for the current language), and `categoryEmoji` by the `loadQuestionsFromJson` function.
    *   The `useQuestions` hook manages the state of `allQuestions`, `currentRoundQuestions`, and `playedQuestions`.

## 5. Question Object Structure (In-App)

After processing by `loadQuestionsFromJson` and within the `useQuestions` hook, each question object available to the application components (like `QuestionCard.tsx`) has this structure (defined in `types.ts`):

```typescript
export interface Question {
  questionId: string;     // Unique identifier from the JSON file
  text: string;           // Question text from the JSON file
  categoryId: string;     // Category ID (e.g., "party")
  categoryName: string;   // Translated category name (e.g., "Party" or "Fiesta")
  categoryEmoji: string;  // Emoji for the category (e.g., "ðŸŽ‰")
}
```

## 6. Fallback Mechanism

- If a specific `public/questions/{lang}/{category_id}.json` file is not found or fails to load, `loadQuestionsFromJson` in `lib/utils/questionLoaders.ts` has a basic fallback mechanism (e.g., trying to load English questions if the German file for a category is missing). This is currently handled by attempting to fetch from the primary language and then, if that fails, it might log a warning. A more robust, multi-step fallback (e.g., DE -> EN -> default set) could be implemented if needed.
- If `categories.json` itself fails to load, or if no questions can be loaded for any selected category, the `useQuestions` hook will use `getFallbackQuestions()` from `lib/utils/questionLoaders.ts` to provide a default set of questions, ensuring the game can still proceed.

This consolidated approach ensures that all question and category data fetching originates from `lib/utils/questionLoaders.ts`, using `getAssetsPath` for reliable path construction. Redundant loaders in other parts of the codebase have been removed.
